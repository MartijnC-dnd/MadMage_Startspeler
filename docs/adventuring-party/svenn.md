## Personal Decisions

Having to join the battle against [Shimmergloom](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Haerinvureem), I prayed for guidance and support to [Clangeddin Silverbeard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Clangeddin_Silverbeard).

Our great Father of Battle and the Lord of the Twin Axes guided me with his blessing and bestowed power upon me to smite my foes.

Becoming a paladin was a natural consequence of my unwavering faith. In taking my vows, I became the holy axe of my clan (and in extension my god [Clangeddin Silverbeard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Clangeddin_Silverbeard)).

## Life Events

###  Spent time working  
In my early years I got recruited into the city watch.  
During this time I was in charge of a small group to handle incidents all around Mithral Hall.  
Incidents included:
  - Small Crimes
  - Home invasions
  - Trespassers
  - ...

###  A supernatural experience  
During one of the home invasions call, my group and I stumbled upon an empty house.  
During exploration we found that the house was haunted by the previous occupants and enlisted several clerics to help with removing the curse and setting the spirits free.  
During this time I came to good terms with **Clerics**

###  Fell in love and got married  
When I was a younger dwarf (~60) I met the love of my life. (**Ilde**).
We fell in love head over heels and got married within a year.
After getting married I became more careful in battle and during my city watches.

###  Made an enemy (Blameless)  
I made an enemy of a human fighter (**Lucian**).  
He came to our home to seek aid.  
Once he recovered he tried to take *Aegis-Fang* [ref.](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aegis-fang) for himself.  
When I confronted him, he swore to take his revenge at a later time.  
He soon left **Mithral Hall** without *Aegis-Fang* [ref.]([ref.](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aegis-fang)).

### Spent time working  
After working for the Civil Watch for several years, I got promoted to: Investigator.  
During this time I was responsible for solving crimes after the fact.  
I had to investigate crime scenes and track down criminals.  

### Went on an adventure  
Due to my experiences as an investigator I was tasked to track down a missing shipment of ores.   
While hunting it down, I found out a group of goblins, lead by their bugbear chieftain was responsible.  
During the fight I got slashed over my left eye and the scar is still not fully healed.  
I doubt it will ever fully recover.  
For my bravery and for being wounded during my service I received a *Cloak of Protection* [ref.](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/cloak-of-protection) (they said I could use it)

### Made a friend  
I made friends with a human bard (**Jaskier**).  
Shortly after my adventure, we met a human bard in a tavern.  
We quickly became friends and he sang the most wonderful songs about adventurers.  
He even had a song about the great reclaiming of **Mithral Hall**.  
A strange song about a White Wolf fighting a silver-tongued devil still does not make sense to me. [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9OQAySv184)  

### Suffered a tragedy  
While I was away on the adventure, correspondance with **Ilde** stopped.  
I feared the worst.   
Upon my return, I found out my wife **Ilde** passed away in an unfortunate accident.  

## What brings me to Undermountain

In 1370 DR, several survivors of the [Clan Melairkyn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Melairkyn) were seeking refuge in **Mithral Hall**.
They told the tale of their plan to re-take **Undermountain** as their own.
This is their tale:
> Some of the surviving Clan Melairkyn worshipers of Clangeddin Silverbeard assembled Clangeddin's Hearth, the organization with one goal - to take back the clan's ancient home deep in Undermountain. With Halaster's disappearance in 1369 DR, Clangeddin's Hearth seized the opportunity to establish an outpost in the clan's abandoned temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard in Undermountain. During the same period of time, drow reestablished their presence in Undermountain, often clashing with the dwarves.

> In 1370 DR, Clangeddin's Hearth's dwarves attempted to wash a tribe of kobolds out of Undermountain's sewers. The drow used the kobolds as scouts and overwatch by the drow, led by Matron Azurna, and this attack angered her enough to take decisive action against Clangeddin's Hearth. She led the squad of drow assassins to slaughter almost every dwarf in the temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard.

> Only a handful of Clangeddin's Hearth members remained alive.

The surviving dwarves told their tale. Our current leader [Dagnabbet Waybeard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dagnabbet_Waybeard) feels sorrow for their tale and she wishes to seek justice and retribution for this once great clan.  
A decision has been made to send out a scouting party to see if there is an opportunity to re-take **Undermountain** and claim it for our home once again.  
I have been selected to join this party.

Together with my fellow companions:
- Hafle Battlehammer:  
>Male Dwarf Paladin  
Hafle has thick gray hair and dark gray eyes, and a thin nose. He wears a breastplate and wields a pike. Hafle is charming and generous.
- Burgga Bronzebeard
> Female Dwarf Fighter  
Burgga is tall, with matted brown hair and large brown eyes. She wears splint armor and wields a greataxe. Burgga seeks only fame and glory.
- Agag Dotidotr
> Female Dwarf Barbarian  
Agag is exceptionally beautiful, with braided white hair and brown eyes. She wears hide armor and wields a shortsword. Agag has an animal companion, a copper firedrake named Addolf.
- Olaff Sigurdson
Male Dwarf Ranger  
>Thidre is short and heavyset, with auburn hair and amber eyes. He wears leather armor and wields a flail. Thidre has a black eagle named Thorki.

Blessed by my God and my clan I ventured to Waterdeep and deep into the **Undermountain**.  
Hoping to find:
- The abandoned temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard
  - To discover the truth of what happened here so long ago
- An opportunity to establish a camp or settlement
- An audience with the powerful **Mad Mage Hallaster**
  - To restore the temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard to the rightful owners and former glory

## How did I meet Jasper

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler Warning (only for Jasper)</summary>
  <p>Full name, Illphar Bluebow</p>
</details>

During our exploration of the **Undermountain**, the group ran into trouble.  
We stumbled upon a large encampment of drow.  
Many of our dwarves fought valiantly and the drow numbers soon dwindled.  
Cowardly as they are, they used a spellcaster to create magical darkness around us.  
I heard cries of agonay as my brethren fell to the ground.  
I started to panick.  
The darkness engulfed me.  
Ready to swing my axe for the last time.  

The end didn't come, no sharp cold steel in my side, no spell burning me alive.  
Only quiet and a soft moan and drips of blood in the mud.  
The darkness fell.  

In front of me, a drow spellcaster with a blade planted in her back by a **half-drow**(?)  
Hesitant I started to talked to him, I owe my life to this half-drow.  
After more talking and getting to know each other, I found out he despises the drow as well.  
We decided to team up and try and find the temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard (while getting vengeance on the drow in the meantime)  
I immediately bonded with his companion, a raven called **Huginn**.  
The raven now perches on my shoulder and assists me in battle.  
I've grown to liking this raven and his keeper.
