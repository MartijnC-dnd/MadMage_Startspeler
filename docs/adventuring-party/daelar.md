### Personality Traits

I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.
The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuableâ€”or where such things could be hidden.

### Ideals

People. Iâ€™m loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral)

### Bonds

Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again.

### Flaws

If thereâ€™s a plan, Iâ€™ll forget it. If I donâ€™t forget it, Iâ€™ll ignore it.

## Backstory

I am an explorer of the dark and forgotten places of the world, places few others would be willing to delve. Ancient tombs and pyramids buried beneath the sand, forgotten subterranean temples and the maze-like sprawl of caverns that once made up a lost civilization.

During my encounters I uncovered many treasures as well as helped a lot of people to find their lost loves/sons/daughters/...

One encounter in the mines of phandelver did not end well and I ended up losing the love of my life. After this tragic event, I have been trying to find a group of adventurers to call family again.
