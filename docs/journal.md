  <summary>Entry 1 - Journey to Waterdeep</summary>
  <h2></h2>
  <p> We meet a caravan of merchants who sell dubious, exotic wares. </p>
  <p> All these expensive wares are too much for us, we just want to continue one. </p>
  <p> Couple of miles onward we find a hurt merchant who cries out for help. He seems to be lightly injured, but fine otherwise. He tells us that he has been robbed by a bunch of bandits and needs our help to get his stuff back, promising to pay us in return. We decide to help him out. He lead us to a bandits hideout, where the bandits were lying in wait for us, because that crooked, "merchantâ€œ was part of them! </p>
  <p> They didn't stand a chance against the mighty heroes of Mitrhall Hall. </p>
  <p> Here is to hoping the rest of the journey is uneventful. </p>

  <summary>Entry 2 - The Yawning Portal</summary>
  <h2></h2>
  <p> We arrived at the Yawning Portal. </p>
  <p> It was even more impressive then they told us. So many beers, wines, ciders, liquors, etc. I could hardly choose something to order! Not to mention all the delicious food. </p>
  <p> While we were sitting at one of the tables a man approached us. He thought he could ask us for a favour. Since we were going to Undermountain, he wanted us to look for an Alabaster Throne. If we found it, he could reward us handsomely. We accepted. He bought us some more beers and who were we to decline a good cold brew? </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Entry 3 - Entering the Undermountain</summary>
  <p> We entered the Undermountain through the giant hole in the inn. The winch ride took ages. </p>
  <p> Once we arrived down in the first level of the dungeon, an eerie feeling came over me. It felt like we weren't the only ones who are in this place.</p>
  <p> We have this feeling we are being watched. In the small hallways, we find several monsters which have been slain. We do encounter some monsters, especially some hobgoblins. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Entry 4 - An unexpected encounter</summary>
  <p> After entering the 2nd level, we enter a big room with several draped walls. Several wooden stands are manned by goblins. Upon entering what I can only call a Goblin Bazar, the Goblins panick. They immediately pack up their things. </p>
  <p> A Hobgoblin approaches, he asks us what our business is in this place. We explain we don't want any trouble and are just look for the Temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard. He tells us not to cause any troubles. </p>
  <p> They seem to be selling some rations and crudely made equipment and tools. </p>
  <p> Even for the worst of wares they ask absurd prices. They are probably trying to scam us. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Entry 5 - Ale a' plenty!</summary>
  <p> Still on the 2nd level, we find a long hallway full with traps. Olaff Sigurdson, our scout ventured in the hallway first. He triggers some traps, but clumsy as he is, gets trapped in one of them. </p>
  <p> At the end of the hallway, we find a secret door, which wasn't closed properly. Maybe someone was here? </p>
  <p> In the room a huge amount of barrels with beer are stacked on top of each other. Of course we try some. It seems to be the long forgotten ale of the dwarves! We are on the correct path. </p>
  <p> Each of use fills up his/her waterskin to savour this nectar of the gods even longer. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Entry 6 - Drow Infestation</summary>
  <p> We travel through to the 3rd level. We start to discover more spiderwebs. Eventually we arrive in a throne room, riddled with Spider Webs. Giant spiders try to ambush us, but are quickly outmatched. Strewn acros this place are several Drow corpses. We arrive in what seems to be a drow village. Most of the houses are empty and the town inhabitants seem to be brutally murdered. </p>
  <p> In our travels we find several dirt mounds. Interstingly, plants have started to grow from these mounds. Although pale it seems someone has planted some magically infused flowers around here. Did someone come here to plant these? </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Entry 7 - Stone Sculptures</summary>
  <p> Still on the 3rd level, we stumble upon a giant room filled with Stone Sculptures. It seems they aren't quite finished yet. The doors were engraved with images of dwarves. Luckily we could easily open them all. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Entry 8 - Border Patrol</summary>
  <p> During our search to reach the 4th level, we encounter a Hobgoblin warchief. We are stopped by a patrol of hobgoblins which say we have to register to enter the warchiefs domain. </p>
  <p> We don't want to cause any trouble and comply. It takes forever and seems like such a giant waste of time. They note down everything, our names, occupations, cause of business. They even take a sketch! </p>
  <p> While I was waiting, I was able to look at other entries in their books. It seems several adventurers have registered in the past days. </p>
  <p> One sketch specifically catches my eyes. It appears to be an Eladrin Elf dressed in dark leather gear, wielding heavy crossbow. He had long flowing hair. He seemed to be a ranger, or a rogue? Something like that. </p>
</details>

> From here on, the handwriting changes. The once stylized flowing elegant letters change in crude skribbles in uncontrolled movements.

<details>
  <summary>Entry 9 - Ambush</summary>
  <p> WE WERE AMBUSHED BY DROW. </p>
  <p> A half-drow saved us?? This has got to be a set-up! </p>
  <p> Half-drow seems good. He has his motives. Better not to make him angry. </p>
  <p> I will continue on this mission! May you find piece in the afterlife. </p>
  <ul>
  <li> Hafle Battlehammer </li>
  <li> Burgga Bronzebeard </li>
  <li> Agag Dotidotr </li>
  <li> Olaff Sigurdson </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You will not be forgotten. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Entry 10 - Woods? Sun?</summary>
  <p> Feels like we are in a dome. There is sunlight, trees, a flowing river. Only thing missing is wind. </p>
  <p> Ents drag bodies to a stone(?) tree. We check it out. Two bodies: an eladrin (from the sketch?) and a drow. Were they companions? </p>
  <p> We enter the stone tree. Meet a druid called Willow. </p>
  <p> Willow is dissapointed because other adventurers attacked her dragon(?). Rumours of dwarven ruins in the next level. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Entry 11 - Dwarven ruins</summary>
  <p> Proceed to the dwarven ruins as described by Willow </p>
  <p> Find a library, not much to learn for now. </p>
  <p> Lots of noise from a room. We go to investigate. Another party! </p>
  <p> Strange cohesions. Seems there are trust issues here. They are the ones who lost the companions whose bodies were dragged to Willow? </p>
  <p> They want to give them an appropriate goodbye. We tell them to be respectful and they should be good. </p>
  <p> Lots of doubt. No clear guidance. They eventually decide not to risk it. </p>
  <p> Met a new party: </p>
  <ul>
  <li> Faye </li>
  <li> Sargon </li>
  <li> Alvynn </li>
  </ul>

  <summary>Entry 12 - A new party?</summary>
  <p> Seems to be an interesting group dynamic. </p>
  <p> Do they even trust each other?? </p>
