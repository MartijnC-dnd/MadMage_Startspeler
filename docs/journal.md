  <h2>Journey to Waterdeep</h2>
  <p> We meet a caravan of merchants who sell dubious, exotic wares. </p>
  <p> All these expensive wares are too much for us, we just want to continue one. </p>
  <p> Couple of miles onward we find a hurt merchant who cries out for help. He seems to be lightly injured, but fine otherwise. He tells us that he has been robbed by a bunch of bandits and needs our help to get his stuff back, promising to pay us in return. We decide to help him out. He lead us to a bandits hideout, where the bandits were lying in wait for us, because that crooked, "merchantâ€œ was part of them! </p>
  <p> They didn't stand a chance against the mighty heroes of Mitrhall Hall. </p>
  <p> Here is to hoping the rest of the journey is uneventful. </p>
