## Welcome to the Dungeon of the Mad Mage Github Pages

This github pages site will be used to keep track of the current campaign.  
This page is currently just a play template to gather my own notes and characters.

If you have notes, feel free to provide them and I can store them on this site.  
Taking notes in a markdown format is very easy.

Markdown supports all kinds of different styling options.  
Feel free to take a look at: [Basic Writing and Formatting](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)  
This should help you on your way and you will be able to take notes efficiently in no time.

You can send me the notes via the group chats we have ongoing for the campaign or directly.  
If you want to contribute and maintain the entire page or push your notes directly, let me know.

Kind regards,
Martijn Claes (~~Daelar~~/Svenn)
